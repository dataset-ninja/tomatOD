**tomatOD: Tomato Fruit Localization and Ripening Classification** is a dataset for object detection tasks. It is used in the agriculture industry. 

The dataset consists of 277 images with 2797 labeled objects belonging to 3 different classes including *unripe*, *fully-ripe*, and *semi-ripe*.

Images in the tomatOD dataset have bounding box annotations. All images are labeled (i.e. with annotations). There are 2 splits in the dataset: *Test* (55 images) and *Train* (222 images). The dataset was released in 2020 by the [up2metric, Greece](http://www.up2metric.com/computer-vision-ai/).
